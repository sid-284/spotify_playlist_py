Project Proposal: Spotify AI Song Recommendation Using Machine Learning
(by Sidharth Mohan)
Introduction This project aims to develop a Spotify AI Song Recommendation system that leverages machine learning to create personalized song recommendations based on user input. The user will provide a prompt (e.g., "rock-EDM" or a specific song), and the system will recommend a list of 50 songs related to the search term.
Objectives
Develop a machine learning model to identify and recommend songs based on a given prompt.
Integrate the model with Spotify's API to fetch song data.
Create a user-friendly interface for inputting search prompts.
Generate a list of 50 recommended songs based on the user input.
Methodology 3.1. Data Collection
Spotify API: Use Spotify (a Python library for the Spotify Web API) to collect data on songs, including features like genre, tempo, key, and popularity.
3.2. Data Preprocessing
Clean and normalize the data to ensure consistency.
Feature extraction: Focus on relevant features such as genre, tempo, key, energy, and danceability.
3.3. Model Development
Model Selection: Use machine learning algorithms like k-nearest neighbors (KNN) or support vector machines (SVM) to find similar songs.
Training and Evaluation: Train and evaluate the model using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
3.4. Integration with Spotify API
Authentication: Set up OAuth2 authentication to access Spotify's API.
Data Fetching: Fetch song data from Spotify using the trained model to recommend songs based on user input.
3.5. User Interface
Develop a simple command-line interface (CLI) where users can input their search prompt.
Display the list of recommended songs.
Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Spotipy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
Spotify API: For accessing and manipulating Spotify data
Timeline
Week 1: Project setup, data collection, data preprocessing
Week 2: Model selection, training, and initial evaluation
Week 3: Integration with Spotify API and recommendation logic
Week 4: User interface development, testing, and debugging
Detailed 4-Week Action Plan

 Week 1: Project Setup, Data Collection, and Preprocessing
Project Setup:
Set up a GitHub repository for version control.
Create a virtual environment and install necessary libraries: Spotipy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.
Familiarize yourself with the Spotify API and Spotipy.
Data Collection:
Use Spotipy to authenticate with the Spotify API.
Write scripts to collect song data, focusing on features such as genre, tempo, key, energy, danceability, and popularity.
Collect a diverse dataset covering various genres and styles.
Data Preprocessing:
Clean and normalize the dataset to ensure consistency.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations.
Select relevant features for training the machine learning model.

Week 2: Model Selection, Training, and Initial Evaluation
Model Selection:
Choose a suitable algorithm for song similarity (e.g., k-nearest neighbors (KNN) or support vector machines (SVM)).
Implement and test the chosen algorithm on a subset of the data.
Training and Evaluation:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

Week 3: Integration with Spotify API and Recommendation Logic
Spotify API Integration:
Set up OAuth2 authentication to access Spotify’s API securely.
Write functions to fetch song data from Spotify using the API.
Recommendation Logic:
Implement the logic to recommend 50 songs based on user input (prompt).
Ensure the model uses the trained algorithm to find similar songs and generate recommendations.

Week 4: User Interface Development, Testing, and Debugging
User Interface Development:
Develop a simple command-line interface (CLI) for user input.
Optionally, create a basic web interface using Flask or Django if time permits.
Testing and Debugging:
Test the entire workflow, from user input to song recommendations.
Debug any issues and ensure the system works smoothly.
Documentation and Final Presentation:
Write comprehensive documentation explaining the project, including setup instructions, usage, and underlying methodologies.
Prepare a presentation to showcase the project’s features and capabilities.

Expected Outcomes
A functional machine learning model capable of recommending personalized songs.
A user-friendly interface for inputting search prompts and receiving song recommendations.
Comprehensive documentation detailing the project development process.
Conclusion The Spotify AI Song Recommendation system aims to enhance the music discovery process by leveraging machine learning and the vast data available through the Spotify API. By the end of this project, users will be able to receive personalized song recommendations based on their specific music preferences and enjoy a more tailored listening experience.
