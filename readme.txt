Project Proposal: Spotify AI Playlist Link Generator Using Machine Learning 							(by Sidharth Mohan)
1. Introduction
This project aims to develop a Spotify AI Playlist Link Generator that leverages machine learning to create personalized playlists based on user input. The user will provide a prompt (e.g., "rock-EDM" or a specific song), and the system will generate a playlist of 50 songs related to the search term. The final output will be a Spotify playlist link.

2. Objectives
Develop a machine learning model to identify and recommend songs based on a given prompt.
Integrate the model with Spotify's API to fetch song data and generate playlists.
Create a user-friendly interface for inputting search prompts.
Generate a 50-song playlist and return the corresponding Spotify link.

3. Methodology
3.1. Data Collection
Spotify API: Use Spotify (a Python library for the Spotify Web API) to collect data on songs, including features like genre, tempo, key, and popularity.
3.2. Data Preprocessing
Clean and normalize the data to ensure consistency.
Feature extraction: Focus on relevant features such as genre, tempo, key, energy, and danceability.
3.3. Model Development
Model Selection: Use machine learning algorithms like k-nearest neighbors (KNN) or support vector machines (SVM) to find similar songs.
Training and Evaluation: Train and evaluate the model using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
3.4. Integration with Spotify API
Authentication: Set up OAuth2 authentication to access Spotify's API.
Playlist Generation: Use the trained model to generate a list of 50 songs based on the user input.
Link Creation: Create a Spotify playlist with the selected songs and generate a shareable link.
3.5. User Interface
Develop a simple command-line interface (CLI) where users can input their search prompt.
Display the generated playlist and provide the Spotify link.

4. Tools and Technologies
Programming Language: Python
Libraries: Spotipy, Pandas, Scikit-learn
Spotify API: For accessing and manipulating Spotify data

6. Detailed 4-Week Action Plan

Week 1: Project Setup, Data Collection, and Preprocessing

Project Setup:
Set up a GitHub repository for version control.
Create a virtual environment and install necessary libraries: Spotipy, Pandas, Scikit-learn, etc.
Familiarize yourself with the Spotify API and Spotipy.

Data Collection:
Use Spotipy to authenticate with the Spotify API.
Write scripts to collect song data, focusing on features such as genre, tempo, key, energy, danceability, and popularity.
Collect a diverse dataset covering various genres and styles.

Data Preprocessing:
Clean and normalize the dataset to ensure consistency.
Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and correlations.
Select relevant features for training the machine learning model.


Week 2: Model Selection, Training, and Initial Evaluation
Model Selection:
Choose a suitable algorithm for song similarity (e.g., k-nearest neighbors (KNN) or support vector machines (SVM)).
Implement and test the chosen algorithm on a subset of the data.

Training and Evaluation:
Split the dataset into training and testing sets.
Train the model on the training set and evaluate its performance using metrics like precision, recall, and F1-score.
Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.
Week 3: Integration with Spotify API and Link Creation

Spotify API Integration:
Set up OAuth2 authentication to access Spotify’s API securely.
Write functions to create and populate playlists on Spotify using the API.

Playlist Generation:
Implement the logic to generate a 50-song playlist based on user input (prompt).
Ensure the model uses the trained algorithm to find similar songs and compile the playlist.

Link Creation:
Create a new Spotify playlist with the selected songs.
Generate a shareable link for the playlist.


Week 4: User Interface Development, Testing, and Debugging

User Interface Development:
Develop a simple command-line interface (CLI) for user input.
Optionally, create a basic web interface using Flask or Django if time permits.

Testing and Debugging:
Test the entire workflow, from user input to playlist generation and link creation.
Debug any issues and ensure the system works smoothly.

Documentation and Final Presentation:
Write comprehensive documentation explaining the project, including setup instructions, usage, and underlying methodologies.
Prepare a presentation to showcase the project’s features and capabilities.

7. Expected Outcomes
A functional machine learning model capable of generating personalized playlists.
A user-friendly interface for inputting search prompts and receiving playlist links.
Comprehensive documentation detailing the project development process.
8. Conclusion
The Spotify AI Playlist Link Generator aims to enhance the music discovery process by leveraging machine learning and the vast data available through the Spotify API. By the end of this project, users will be able to generate personalized playlists based on their specific music preferences and enjoy a seamless music-listening experience.
